            <p>Hi, I’m Sarah, a graphic designer specializing in social media 
                and branding, with a growing interest in web design. I focus on 
                creating designs that are clear, engaging, and visually appealing. 
                Whether it's building a brand identity or designing social media 
                content, I enjoy the opportunity to create work that will connect with 
                viewers and conveys ideas effectively.</p>
             <p>Currently, I’m expanding my skill set by learning web design. 
                This website will serve as a space for me to experiment, practice, 
                and eventually showcase my work as a portfolio.</p>
